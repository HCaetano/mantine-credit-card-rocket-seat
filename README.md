## About

This project's goals are for me to practice my coding skills building an UI following a clearly defined [design](https://www.figma.com/file/qdmq94aqNZ6AQEwXpWdqg0/Formul%C3%A1rio-de-Cart%C3%A3o-%E2%80%A2-Desafio-13-(Community)?type=design&node-id=101-680&t=BmtI0Bn7hVB3NriL-0), to get to learn about [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=pt-br). 

It started as me creating a UI to learn about Mantine to used it at work, but very quickly I decided I wanted to host this project to make it easily available, so I got into Firebase (I'm loving it!) and I also quickly noticed I wanted to go beyond the design, so I started validating all fields and added persistence. Now I'm working on creating a page to display all saved cards and also a page for each card, in which it'll possible to edit or delete them.
